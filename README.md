# Burger Time

## Burger Time
Burger Time is a simple, full-stack application utilizing Express.js for server routing, a MySQL database dynamically updated by user input, and Handlebars.js for HTML templating. Users are presented with a burger menu to which they can add burgers of their own creation. Once they've eaten a burger, they can click the "DEVOUR!" button to move them to a list of previously eaten burgers.

## Motivation
The Burger Time project was an opportunity to further familiarize myself with full-stack applications in addition to HTML templating and MySQL databases.

## Deployed Application
To demo the application, vist https://polar-savannah-91822.herokuapp.com/.
